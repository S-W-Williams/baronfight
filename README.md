##Gameplay
Final Boss Veigar is at it again! But his game code has accidentally generated a boss of its own for Veigar to face! In your way stand 8 different versions of Baron Nashor. But be careful, as each Baron grows higher and higher in difficulty and strength.

To battle Baron Nashor, Veigar's code has generated an arsenal of tools for your disposal! Draw chains of 3 or more same-colored orbs to deal physical damage to your enemies. The longer the chain, the more damage you deal!

##Runes

With Baron Nashor getting stronger and stronger every level, how will you be able to fight back? Fear not! Each time you defeat Baron Nashor, you are presented with a selection of runes to empower your character. And while these runes very closely mimic the effects of their in-game counterparts, <b>their effects have been amplified significantly, </b>making it much more important for the player to look through their effects and determine what would be most helpful for the next boss.

<b>Every rune from the new Runes Reforged System has an in-game counterpart in Bust-A-Baron.</b> While the impact of these runes have been scaled up to make their effects much more impactful in game, at heart, they are still the same runes at heart. Knowing what runes to pick in Bust-A-Baron will not only familiarize players with the new runes in League of Legends, but it will also make it easier for players to decide what runes are appropriate against every opponent.
